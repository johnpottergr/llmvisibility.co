If you're working on conversion rate optimization for a website, there's a new tool you’ll want to start using: OpenAI’s GPT-4o. Beyond interpreting visuals, it's also very sharp at identifying what’s not working on a webpage and how to improve it.

This article will show you how to leverage this technology for CRO. Using the guide below, you can run several CRO challenges across different B2B SaaS landing pages. It will deliver conversion-focused suggestions that are smart and actionable. Let's begin.

## Start with a Clear Expert Persona
Before asking 4o to analyze anything, define who it's pretending to be. You’ll get helpful output if you start your prompt by assigning it a role. Stating “conversion expert” won't cut it, you'll need something more detailed.

For example, you could say: “You are a senior CRO specialist with 10+ years of experience improving SaaS landing pages, particularly for startups targeting mid-market buyers. You understand user psychology, design best practices, and messaging frameworks like PAS and AIDA.”

The more context you give, the more relevant the output will be.

## Upload a Screenshot, Not a Link
Don’t paste in a URL and expect a quality output.

Instead, upload a full-page screenshot. GPT-4o’s Vision model is built to analyze visual layouts directly, and screenshots provide much clearer input than relying on a page fetch or rendering through a link.

## Ask It to Describe the Page First
Before jumping into optimization suggestions, ask 4o to describe what it sees. You can include this as the first step of your prompt. This task....

- Allows you to verify that it interprets the page correctly
- Actually improves the quality of its suggestions

Another smart tip is to ask it to describe everything it sees on the page from top to bottom before it offers suggestions. Sometimes you'll catch weird interpretation issues this way. It also gives the model a stronger starting point.

## Give It Context Like You Would a Colleague
To get genuinely helpful feedback, feed GPT-4o the background a strategist would need. Include:

- What counts as a conversion (demo request? email sign-up?)
- Who the target audience is. Be specific. Are they decision-makers? DIY users?
- How people are landing on the page. Is it from ads, organic search, email?
- Any other context that influences messaging or structure.

Don't hold back. The more grounded your prompt is in the real-life funnel, the better the suggestions will be.

## Guide the Analysis
Now you’re ready to ask for a full CRO teardown using its Vision capabilities. Remember to be specific: “Use your Vision features to analyze this screenshot and provide conversion-focused suggestions. Don’t use Code Interpreter.”

You can even direct it to focus on certain areas like CTA placement, headline clarity, hierarchy, or visual flow.

## Last Tips Before Prompt
If you want to really get the most from ChatGPT-4o:

- Be precise about what you want from the model.
- Speak to it like you would a collaborator, provide motivation and context.
- Use clear language.
- Use natural language endings, even a thank you adds clarity
