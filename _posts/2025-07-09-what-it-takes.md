## The Goal: Build a Stack That Performs:
- **LLM citation scans:** to identify where your brand is being referenced in AI-generated answers across LLM tools, and how often it appears.
- **Prompt recall tests:** to evaluate how well your content shows up in response to common AI prompts, and whether that content is accurate.
- **Linkless mention tracking:** to spot brand mentions that appear in forums, summaries, and AI outputs even when there’s no backlink.
- **Crawlability for AI bots:** to check if your content is accessible to AI-oriented crawlers and isn’t blocked by rendering issues or robots.txt settings.
- **Pull in:** search-generated citations and prompt-level results using browser automations and n8n scripts.

## The Recipe
### 1. Prompt Recall Tests
Test whether your content appears in response to relevant prompts.

**Manual Testing:**

- ChatGPT Plus ($20/mo) – GPT-4o for manual recall tests

**Automation (optional):**
- Playwright or Puppeteer – Browser automation for simulating prompt entry across tools
n8n – For scheduling and orchestrating prompt runs
- Claude API or OpenAI API – To score results for accuracy and brand inclusion

## 2. LLM Citation Scans
Check if your brand is cited in LLM answers and where it’s sourced from.

**Citation-exposing LLMs:**

- Perplexity Pro – Shows citations and sources
- You.com – Another citation-enabled tool
- Bing Copilot – Sometimes includes sources

Scraping tools (for non-API access):

- Playwright/Puppeteer (same as above) – To extract citations from UI
n8n or Zapier – To automate scraping and logging

## 3. Linkless Mention Tracking
Monitor forums, summaries, and AI outputs for brand mentions without backlinks.

**Tools:**

- Mention.com, Brand24, or Talkwalker Alerts – Track unlinked mentions online
- Google Alerts – Free mention tracking
- Reddit API or Pushshift – To pull brand mentions in forums
- Twitter/X API (if needed) – Paid tiers
- Optionally, GPT-4 or Claude – To detect “implied” brand mentions from raw text

## 4. AI Bot Crawlability Checks
Verify if AI crawlers can access your content and see it rendered correctly.

**Tools:**

- Screaming Frog SEO Spider or Sitebulb – Crawlability + render testing
Manual robots.txt review – Look for blocks on GPTBot, Google-Extended, ClaudeBot, etc.
- Playwright– For rendering and testing dynamic content (JS-heavy pages)

## 5. Workflow Automation & Logging

Stitch everything together and log results.

- n8n (cloud or desktop) – Workflow automation
- Airtable, Supabase, or [Google Sheets] – Store test results and citations
- Retool or Streamlit – Optional dashboards

## 6. Reporting & Output (Optional)
Generate audit reports for stakeholders or clients.

**Tools:**

- Jinja2 (templating engine for HTML/PDF)
- Pandas – For data processing and report formatting
- WeasyPrint or PDFKit – Turn HTML into PDFs

## Side note on Linkless Mentions per ChatGPT
Linkless mention tracking is important for LLM visibility because modern language models are trained not just on pages with backlinks but on the full context of language, including brand names mentioned without links. In short: if your brand shows up in the training or inference data—even without a link, it can influence whether you're surfaced in answers.

Here’s why that matters, in practical terms:

LLMs Learn from Language Context, Not Just Links Unlike Google’s PageRank, LLMs aren’t built on link graphs. They "understand" brands through:

- Raw mentions in text (even without a URL)
- Surrounding context (how people describe you)
- Frequency and tone of mentions

So a brand mentioned often in AI-generated articles, Reddit comments, or summaries, even without backlinks, gets semantically associated with direct mail, marketing automation, etc. This raises its chances of showing up in relevant LLM responses.
