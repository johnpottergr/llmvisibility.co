## Turn your SEO strategy into a growth engine
You want to be strategic when it comes to planning content. If you're serious about promoting growth, here's a smart framework to use:

### Begin with bottom-of-funnel (BOFU) content
Do not divert your attention from bottom of funnel pages until they rank and convert. They are the ones that directly drive sales.

WIth BOFU content, make sure you:

- Target the most high intent keywords
- Check that your site has fast load times
- Your site is fully functional on all devices
- Optimize your headers and meta descriptions
- Present compelling calls to action

### Populate the Funnel with MOFU Content

With your BOFU content set up, it’s time to work on the middle of the funnel. Your prospective customers still have questions, and they need to know more before they’re ready to buy. So the onus is on you to answer those questions.

High converting blog posts and comparison pages are the best way to achieve this.

To fill your funnel with MOFU content, focus on these key areas:

- Make sure your internal links are easy to follow and your site data is well-organized
- Employ keyword groups that reflect purchase research
- Publish six new pieces of mid-funnel content each month

### Long Term Authority Content

If you aren’t an enterprise brand or working to build topical authority over a long period, there’s no need to invest heavily in TOFU (top of funnel) content. Its not worth your time.

Instead, focuse on educational content that is helpful and not filler.

## Technical SEO Still Matters
If your site’s technical foundation is weak, great content won’t perform.

Direct-to-cconsumer brands should be careful to:

- Fix broken links and indexation issues
- Audit site speed and mobile performance
- Review headers and meta tags
- Clean up orphan pages and crawl waste

### The Right Ways to Build Links

Once your funnel content is in place, amplify it with real backlinks by:

- Manual outreach, not link farms
- Relationship building with relevant publishers
- Earning links to your BOFU and MOFU pages

Backlinks not only improve authority, they signal relevance to Google and push your funnel content higher in the rankings.

## Last Words
Don’t overcomplicate your SEO strategy. You won't be able to cover all your bases. But you can be ready when a prospective customer is ready to buy. So:

- Build BOFU pages first
- Use MOFU content to feed demand
- Let bigger brands play with TOFU
- Optimize your site’s technical health
- Earn links that matter

Follows the points to turn your SEO funnel into a sales funnel.
