As AI tools become more acccessible, app development has become easier. SEO professionals are starting to apply their expertise to build practical applications. One such professional is Deyan Georgiev from Toro Rank. I recently asked him to discuss an innovative app he built.

### What does your tool do, and why should we care? (spoiler: we should)
The tool I built addresses two problems I see often while working with clients. Businesses are missing content opportunities and accidentally hurting their SEO with off-topic content just to get more traffic, or their SEO guy/agency can validate their invoice. Interviewer's note: Use Serper API with app.

Instead of guessing what to write about, it shows you exactly what real people are asking that competitors aren't answering well. It scrapes Reddit for actual user questions (with upvote counts), grabs Google's autocomplete suggestions, and analyzes how thin competitor content is. Then it maps everything visually so you can clearly see the gaps and opportunities.

The second part audits your entire website to find pages that don't match your main topic, which sounds boring can be a huge problem. I've found sites where 40% of their content was completely off-topic, basically telling Google they don't know what their business is about.

### Why did you create it?
I had the idea of building something similar for a long time, but I didn’t quite have the time to sit down and do it properly. That was until I started working with a client who had a massive website, but their blog content was completely messed up topic-wise.

Their blog posts were all over the place, and there was no connection to each other or to their main business. The site was too big to manually review every article, so I needed a way to quickly identify which content was actually hurting them.

That's how the website audit feature came about. I built it because I needed to solve that problem ASAP.

Once I could see their content landscape clearly, the next challenge was helping them target better topics that actually made sense for their niche. That's when I added the 3D vector analysis and content gap discovery to find opportunities within their actual expertise area instead of random topics, or tools’ KW suggestions with high traffic potential and low difficulty.

Especially with AI mode and AIO in other countries, we should stop believing in keyword estimates given by the big SEO tools. Because that’s what they are - estimates, not hard data. Google Keyword Planner gives some insights on keyword volume and such, but I think it’s a bit bloated, to say the least. Therefore, most content strategies are built on assumptions.

### Yes, Toro Rank Meets A Real Need
The tool I built isn’t a game-changer, but at least it uses real data - actual questions from Reddit users, real searches from Google autocomplete, and actual competitor analysis. No guessing, no estimates, no assumptions.

The Reddit piece is especially powerful because upvotes tell you which problems people actually care about. If 200 people upvoted a question about "my smart TV OS is slow" but no competitor has a decent guide on it, that's free traffic sitting there.

I’m giving the tool away for free because good content strategy shouldn't only be available to people who can afford the expensive tools. This is in fact the sixth free tool I built and shared for free, and there will be more to come, so stay tuned.
