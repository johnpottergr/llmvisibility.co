MarketMuse is great for larger teams that are serious about content planning. I've been enamored of its features. But to get a full picture, I need to review all aspects of this SEO tool.

## +1: Content Clustering
MarketMuse reveals which topics are worthwhile to cover and clues people in on keyword ranking difficulty and website's 'content authority level'.

It also generates intelligent content plans filled with related topics and keywords. So it helps users think in terms of clusters of content rather than just individual posts.

## +1: Search Intent Comparison
A big draw of MarketMuse is that it evaluates planned content against search intent. Basically, it grades you on how well a future piece of content will serve its potential audience. In other words, it serves as a powerful nudge toward writing truly useful articles that perform well in search engine results.

## +1: Content Monitoring
Additionally, MarketMuse monitors how well existing content is performing and alerts users when something needs fixing. While it also integrates with ChatGPT for writing assistance (this should be standard), it also analyzes how topics interrelate throughout your content.

So MarketMause provides a lot of useful insights. They even hav a MarketMuse Academcy (I LOVE this). But I won't be using it. A big number just jumped out as me. Should of checked first. Change of plans!

## -3: Pricing
As a solopreneur, its foolhardy to disregard pricing. Even low-cost tools are a danger if you're indiscriminate about how many tools you're paying for. Don't leave yourself open to large bill at the end of the month.

With MarketMuse, we're talking $199/month to be on their basic plan. For additional features, this number jumps to $499/month. That's not a problem if you're a large corporation. I'm not.

Even Frase ($114/month to get API) is priced too high for me. Since I'm a writer and not a full-fledged SEO agency, it looks like I might be going for DataForSEO. I'll trade my convenience (its somewhat of a developer tool) for avoiding high monthly bills.

Sure, MarketMuse would be nice. But its not for me. I appreciate there's something for everyone in this marketplace.
