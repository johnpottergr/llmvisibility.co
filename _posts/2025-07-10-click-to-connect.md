Soon, every AI assistant out there will be able to talk directly to your brand. Not scrape your site, not guess what you meant in a blog post, but actually plug into your content, your campaigns, your knowledge base.

As <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/xbora/">Bora Celik</a> explains, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7349046745659539457">a small but significant infrastructure update</a> in the Model Connection Protocol (MCP) world recently occurred to make this possible. For those who haven't been following, MCP is the backbone that lets AI assistants talk to apps and services. Until now, it's mostly been used in business contexts, behind the scenes. But <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/workos-inc/">WorkOS</a>is updating their AuthKit to change.

As of this week, MCP servers can now support oAuth. That means a brand (or any content publisher) can offer a simple "Connect with Claude" or "Use in ChatGPT" button. It's the same idea as "Sign in with Google," but instead of logging in, you're granting access to your brand's structured data, content, or tools.

This changes the rules of engagement for brand visibility.

## Visibility by access, not just indexing

Right now, most marketers that try to reach AI systems think in terms of visibility the old way: get crawled, get indexed, get displayed in an answer. But that's a one-way street. The assistant decides what to extract. You're not part of the loop.

With MCP + oAuth, you're not just hoping to get noticed anymore, you're choosing to be accessible. You can create a persistent, structured connection between your brand and the agent ecosystem. That unlocks some interesting possibilities.

For example:

- Instead of hoping your blog gets scraped, you could give the assistant access to your entire knowledge base, FAQs, or offer database.

- You could flag high-priority campaigns (e.g., seasonal promos) and push them to the top of your assistant-facing feed.

- You could monitor how assistants reference you and in what context. You could see what types of requests they generate, just like web traffic, but semantic.

This means your brand can moves from passive content to active participant.

## What this means for AI Agents doing marketing work

A lot of AI agent tooling today is being built to assist with marketing workflows, like auditing content, suggesting campaigns, scanning competitors. These agents need access to  up-to-date sources.

Most of them right now are scraping the web or relying on outdated datasets. It's not ideal.

If brands start offering MCP + oAuth connections, those agents can:

- Pull structured product info directly from source

- Understand the current state of your promotions, launches, or messaging

- Make comparisons or recommendations with far more context

So you could create a competitive content audit tool that doesn’t guess what your top content is but sees exactly what your brand prioritizes. Because it’s getting it directly. Or a social listening assistant that can detect not just mentions, but intent-aligned responses, because it understands your goals.

## This Also Changes Attribution

One big blind spot for many marketers working in the AI ecosystem is attribution. If a user sees your brand mentioned in an assistant's answer, you might never know. But if the assistant is pulling from your MCP, you can log those events. You can track engagement. You can even build triggers: "If this offer gets referenced 10+ times today, push an update."

That's visibility you can measure.

## Will Everyone Do This?

No. Not right away. Just like not every site has structured product feeds or schema markup, not every brand will rush to set up an MCP server with oAuth. But the ones that do will gain a quiet advantage.

They’ll be easier to work with, easier to cite, easier to surface. AI assistants prioritize speed, clarity, and trusted sources. A well-structured MCP feed ticks all three boxes.

More importantly, this sets the stage for AI-native marketing.

## The Web Isn’t Going Anywhere, But...

You don’t have to believe in the total collapse of the open web to see the writing on the wall. More and more user queries are being intercepted before they hit a browser. If someone asks their home assistant, "What’s the best zero-install solar panel for a small roof?" they’re not getting a list of blue links. They’re getting a synthesized answer.

If your brand is in that answer, great. But how did it get there?

Up until now, it was luck. Scraped content. Maybe a few citations. Maybe not. But soon, it could be because you connected.

You offered access, and that access came with structure, priority, and updates.

## Final thought

Marketers have spent decades trying to reverse-engineer visibility. How to show up in search. How to win the algorithm. How to get noticed.

MCP + oAuth flips that model. Now you can declare visibility. You can offer it, on your terms. And the assistants that matter will be happy to take you up on it.

This might not look all that radical. It might just be a "Connect with Agent" button. But behind that button is an entirely new interface for brand communication.

If you’re thinking about how to stay visible as AI changes user behavior, this is tech to watch.
