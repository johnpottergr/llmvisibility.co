Reaching out to cold leads can be a shot in the dark, but Crystal Knows makes it a lot less intimidating. The software came about after some clever marketer figured out how to leverage public data, behavioral models, and AI to create a smart leads generation tool. It gives sales and marketing teams a psychological edge by providing them with the DISC personality assessments of their prospects.

## Why communication styles are so important
Crystal Knows is somewhat dependent on the client having taken a DISC assessment. If they have, the software can determine whether a lead prefers bullet points or detailed explanations, formal language or casual tone, quick decisions or thoughtful pacing. It's like getting an inside scoop on someone.

But this isnâ€™t just a nice-to-have, it's may make the difference between being ignored and being heard.

It's all based on a simple premise - you should tailor your emails, calls, and outreach strategies to match the communication style of your leads. It's another version of 'matching', a tried and true in-person sales strategy.

Understanding a potential customer is what personalization is all about. It turns what might otherwise be a generic pitch into something much more meaningful.

## My experience with using it on LinkedIn
I'm hardly one to get too excited about marketing tools. But this one was actually fun to use.

To check it out, I used the software's Chrome extension to check out my LinkedIn profile. It gave me a pretty exhaustive about how best to communicate to ...me. And all through a thin side panel on the right side of the LI profile.

The only thing that kind of shook me was that I took the DISC assessment maybe a decade ago. And here it was being used for marketing purposes. Something tells me all this was in the fine print when I signed off on taking it.

In addition to LinkedIn, Crystal Knows also integrates with Salesforce and Gmail, making it easy to write personalized messages where you're already working.

To get a feel for what the Crystal Knows offers, I recommend taking advantage of its free trial.
