So my Clearscope-style tool is workable. I almost had a meltdown from coding frustration but pulled myself together and got it done. Still, its time to compare my original goals with how well it performs now. So I compared my main.py code page with goals and asked ChatGPT for an evaluation.

ChatGPT believes my app satisfies its primary features are satisfied, but argues I could add more. Some of what is suggested WOULD be nice to have. I then asked ChatGPT "Which of these missing features would be most valuable to a content writer?" and why. "Topic Frequency Aggregation" was the top one cited.

## My Top Missing Feature
ChatGPT asserts I should include "Cross-Article Theme and Subtopic Aggregation" within the app. The reasoning is that....

"Writers don’t just want to know what each individual article says, they want a synthesized overview that answers":

- “What are the recurring angles everyone’s covering?”
- “What terms or entities are showing up the most?”
- “Which subtopics or FAQs should I definitely include to stay competitive?” it's true, answering these questions would help make my article more comprehensive but differentiated.

In short order, it would...

- Automatically extract all subtopics and questions from the summaries.
- Count frequency and group similar terms.
- Display a ranked list of the most mentioned themes, subtopics, and questions across all top-ranking articles.

For now, I'm only requesting 10 summaries at a time. I could easily increase that number, but costs are involved.

## Stating the benefits explicitly
ChatGPT notes that, rather than having to read through each summary and manually deduce trends, this feature would basically produce a prioritized content map instead.

And that would save me time, help avoid content gaps, and increase my chances of outperforming competitors in terms of search page results.

## Bonus features I should consider
Additionally, I could highlight frequently mentioned topics (core expectations) and rarely mentioned but important (opportunities to stand out)

This would help a writer decide what to match and where to differentiate, the same kind of information that Clearscope and MarketMuse sell for a premium.
